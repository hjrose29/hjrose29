### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Henry. I am a Sophomore at Oswego State University who loves data! In fact, the majority of each of my projects are largely from material I have self studied.
### My strongest skill's are Python and Java, however, understanding/visualizing relational databases through MySQL and Tableau are not far behind!
### I hope you find a project you like!
