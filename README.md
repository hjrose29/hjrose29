### TLDR: I'm Henry, a Computer Science and Statistics student at Oswego State University - I'm spending my 2024 Summer with JP Morgan, and am currently looking for Spring(2024) and Fall(2024) Co-Ops.

### Hi there 👋

### I am a Junior Computer Science and Statisitics Student at Oswego State University who loves making sense out of data!
### I've worked in all sorts of languages and frameworks but Python🐍 and Java are my most comfortable!
### Outside of school I am a member of my school's [NCAA XC & TF teams](https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/7920460/Oswego_State/Henry_Rose.html)!

### I am currently searching for an internship in Software Engineering/Data Science where I can continue to grow my skillsets!

### I hope you find a project you like!
